# EmotionandLiking
A study built for the course DA2210 at KTH.

# ToDo
under the "Issues" tab you will find everything we need to do to finish the study. 

# How to run the study 
The study can be run very easily by going to the website https://labjs.felixhenninger.com/ and open the Emotion_and_liking.study.json-file there.

# How to edit the study
In lab.js, edit the study however you want. If the study is working perfectly, you can save your code under the name Emotion_and_liking.study.json. Then you can create a pull request with your file, so that we can implement them into the study. 

# How we will run the study
I suggest each group host a version of the study on the website https://open-lab.online/. It is very easy to just upload a lab.js json-file and run the study. All data is automatically saved.
